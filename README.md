## Amazon Clone - React

This is a clone of Amazon website. I used React.js and Tailwind on the UI and [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/products") for the products data.

My motivation building this application was to build a simple e-commerce application with features like adding, removing products to/from basket and authenticating user with Google account.

I will with high possibility add more features in the upcoming days.

### ðŸ’» Tech stack:

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/)

Live [demo](https://react-amazon-clon.netlify.app/).

To run this application in development mode run below npm command to install project's dependencies:

#### `npm install`

You will then need to provide two environment variables. One is `REACT_APP_API_URL` which is Fake Store API products url and the other one is `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY` which Firebase Web API Key.

After providing environment variables you can start the project by running:

#### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
